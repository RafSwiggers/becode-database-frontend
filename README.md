# Becode Database Frontend
Okay, so we've built an API that can read, write, update, delete and list notes. Good job! Of course, the API itself is not something an actual person will ever see.

What is the general idea? Make an html page that calls on our API, and uses it like an actual user would.

## What?
The front-end. Make a page that can be used to make, read, update and delete notes using the API we just built. 

## How?
Html, mostly. Probably also a lot of javascript. A call to the API.
